- test bit and branch

Wow.. is this code obfuscated?

or the compiler really returns like this?

I can't find the condition that this function won't return zero.

### 1. in `.L4`, `L21`, `L7`, `L6`

initializes the allocated array

it finds the char index where it matches with the first character in `arg3` string.
- can assume that it is a string, and `arg4` is a string length.

### 2. in `L5`, `L12`, `L8`, `L22`, `L11`

Here comes the weird part!

I wish that I'm wrong... It's so weird!

let's say 

```c
char* f2(char* s1, int len1, char* s2, int len2);
```

then, the string `s1` should be `s2`'s first character * times the character has appeared in it.

for example
```c
char s[] = "aaaaaaaaaa"; // 10 'a's
char buf[] = "aaabbbaaacccaaadda" // there are 10 'a's in this string
```

and returns weird thing. well, can't be sure what it is, 

but, it seems that it returns the `s1` and `s2`'s address distance plus "starting char." 's number that it appeared in s2.

Wow.. such an uncomfortable ananlyse result here..

I need feedback! T^T
