## code
```arm
f:
        add     w0, w0, w1
        neg     w1, w1
        sub     w0, w0, #1
        and     w0, w0, w1
        ret
```

## description

NEG
- store negative value. (Ã— -1)

## pseudocode

```python
def f(w0,w1):
    return (w0+w1-1) & (-w1)
```

negative means, getting two's complement of original number.

it flips (NOT) every bit and +1.

then what does the code do? What is intended in there?
