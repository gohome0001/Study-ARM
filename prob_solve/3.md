## description

ADRP
- relative address from PC.
- `PC + (imm << 12)` : multiple of 4k 

MOVK
- mov 16 bits
- shifted or not, only modify the 16 bit value
- maintain the unmodified-bit

SXT, SXTA, UXT, UXTA
- if last is not A,
    - b16 stands for two 8 bits to 16bit
    - B stands for 8bit to 32bit
    - h stands for 8bit to 32bit
    - w stands for 32bit to 64bit
- S means signed extension
- U means zeroed extension.
- so, `uxtw` means zeroed extension, 32bit to 64bit.


## pseudo-code
```python
w0 = w0 | w0 >> 1
w1 = 0x04badf0d
w0 = w0 | (w0 << 2)
w0 = w0 | (w0 << 4)
w0 = w0 | (w0 << 8)
w0 = w0 | (w0 << 16)
w0 = w0 * w1
w0 = w0 >> 26
w0 = w0 << # TODO : 19.03.11
