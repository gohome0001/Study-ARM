BLR
- **B**ranch **L**ink to **R**egister
    - link means return address is stored in the stack

STP, LDP
- **ST**ore/**L**oa**D** **P**air of registers.

I do understand that is a some sort of recursion function. 

but, can't get to know what it this thing?

All I can imagine is a binary search algorithm.

the `x19` register is the node of the Red Black Tree

the `[x19, #24]` and `[x19, #16]` is the pointer for the the left, right child node.

and if they are 0, it means it is the leaf node, so they returns.

All I can guess is that.
