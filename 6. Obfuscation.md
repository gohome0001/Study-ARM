# Obfuscation

1. string obfuscation
- using with mov instruction
- shattered string

2. garbage code
- dummy codes.

3. replacting instructions that does same operation. (but less-intuitive)

4. making a mess
- with jumps
- with calls

5. indirect pointers
- if the original to-point addr is `addr` then point `addr-1` and do it properly.

6. custom VM/pseudo code
- define a custom ISA and interpreter, and convert a original code to its format.
